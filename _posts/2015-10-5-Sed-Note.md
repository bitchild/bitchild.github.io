title: Learning Note of Sed

> You must be heard the word, *on-the-fly*, when read some `sed` guide book. It's really a very powerful editor tool (we all know). So in this post, I wanna write down something of my journey in learning it. 

## The Key of Sed Editor ##

Please remember that the `sed` editor is a myriad of commands and formats. And here I described some of the basic commands and features, that you can make life easier. Oh! Another thing you should keep in mind is that `sed` won't modify the original file, but output to the **STDOUT**.

### Substitution Command ###

First, let's see how to replace matching patterns in the test string.

	$ cat a
	this line is line 0
	this line is line 1
	this line is line 2
	this line is line 3
	$
	$
	$ sed 's/line/row/' a
	this row is line 0
	this row is line 1
	this row is line 2
	this row is line 3
